A client wishes to invest in an Airbnb hotel in New York City where they live. Before investing, they would like clear data about the Airbnb performance in that market. I was tasked to carry out data analysis and create a presentation of my recommendations to the client on whether to invest and what neighborhood to invest in.

The following questions were considered in my data analysis:
<br/>1) Which neighbourhoods host the most listings?
<br/>2) What property types receive the most positive reviews?
<br/>3) How much revenue do successful hosts generate?

The dataset originally comes from Inside Airbnb and uploaded on the repository for easy reference.
